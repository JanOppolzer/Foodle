Using Foodle
============

This is a short guide showing users how to create new foodle polls, both event scheduling and multiple choice, as well as tips of how to use foodle.

Foodle is a simple web service that allows you to query some simple data from your colleagues or friends.

Start by going to the Foodle home page:

  * <https://foodle.feide.no>

If you are not logged in, do so by clicking the **login** button. During the authentication process, you need to select where you want to login. If you have a Feide account, choose Feide. If you do not have an account of any of the listed identity providers, you can select **Open IdP (guest users)**, which allows you to register a new user at



Responding to existing Foodles
------------------------------

You probably followed a link that looks like this (this is a test Foodle, that you can use to test):

  * <https://foodle.feide.no/foodle.php?id=zc3c1r38>

Check the columns that you want to check, and click the submit/update button.

You can modify your entry at any time, by logging in on the same URL, and update your entry and click the update button.




Creating a new Foodle
---------------------

On the front page of Foodle, there is a link named **Create new Foodle**.

You will see four tabs where you can enter information:

### Name and description

Fill in a name (header) and description (content) of your Foodle. This text will be visible by the responders. You can add rich content by using the toolbar, or enter text following the [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

### Setup columns

You may create two levels of column headers. You may use only the first level if you do not need *sub-options*.

Example of use of two levels, can be if you use the first level for date, and the second for time slot, like this:

![](http://clippings.erlang.no/ZZ55B57ECF.jpg)

will result in these headers:

**Important**: *All input fields are plain text fields, and you can manually edit them to whatever you want. You do not need to add dates*.


### Advances options

You can set an **expire date**. After that the Foodle will be read-only, and none of the responses can be updated.

You can allow **anonymous access**, that means users that enters the URL, will not be asked to authenticate.

You can limit the **maximum answers** allowed for a foodle. You can choose to limit the number of total responses, or you can limit the number of responses that checks one of the columns.

### Preview and create

Go to the **preview** tab, and review that everythings looks fine in the previewed Foodle. If so, you can click **complete Foodle** to create it.

You will then see a new page telling you that the Foodle is ready, and you will be given a URL that gives direct access to respond to that Foodle. Send this link to those that you would like to respond to the Foodle.
