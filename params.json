{"name":"Foodle","tagline":"Foodle - a simple survey and poll software.","body":"### Welcome to a fork of Foodle\r\nThis page is related to [a fork](https://github.com/JanOppolzer/Foodle) of [Foodle software](https://github.com/UNINETT/Foodle) developed by [UNINETT](https://www.uninett.no/en \"UNINETT\").\r\n\r\nI've decided to fork this piece of software in order to support:\r\n* PHP 5.4 -- the version available in Debian GNU/Linux (a.k.a. Wheezy),\r\n* Czech language.\r\n\r\nDepending on my employer, I'm going to maintain it for our usage and release all the changes I've written. Feel free to fork, contribute or ask any question.\r\n\r\nTo clone my Foodle repository using HTTPS protocol, use the following command:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/JanOppolzer/Foodle.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current development\r\nNowadays, there are two main branches, i.e. *master* and *cesnet*. The first branch contains all changes ready for sending upstream. The second branch contains changes required for our deployment; however, some of them should be tweaked and put upstream. It depends on time, but I believe I'll be able to improve the master branch, eventually.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMaintainer of this fork is Jan Oppolzer (@JanOppolzer).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
