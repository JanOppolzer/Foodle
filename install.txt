# Installing Foodle

Third party installs are NOT prioritised with Foodle (yet). Instead people are encourage to use the central foodl.org service. Contact Andreas for more details.


* Setup simplesamlphp
* Configure the path to simplesamlphp in `www/_include.php`
* Configure `config.php` with correct paths.
* Initialise the database with `config/init.sql`


## Apache setup

Example:


The Alias section is the important one.

	Alias /simplesaml "/var/simplesamlphp-foodle/www"
	Alias /res "/home/www/foodl.org/www/res"
	Alias / /home/www/foodl.org/www/index.php/
